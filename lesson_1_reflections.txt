How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The differences jump out

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could try different things knowing you could always go back a step or more if you didn't like the changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You think about what you are saving and why

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Probably justa matter of preference..?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can (a) see all the changhes made and the history thereof, (b) See the differences between changes made quickly

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back :D

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Track academic progress and reading lists

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
