1
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,102
Before we jump into Python,

2
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:12,870
I want to show you a couple of
features of the Coursera platform.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,720
Here is our course that
I have logged in to.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,940
You see that there is three weeks.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,290
When we click on a week we have
built in Jupyter notebooks.

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,570
Now these are a great way
to learn data science and

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,310
it's something new that the Coursarians
have added to the platform for us.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,205
When you see one of the notebooks
you can click on it,

9
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,335
you can open the notebook
into a new window and

10
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:39,263
you can actually follow along exactly
with everything that we talk about.

11
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:43,335
So you could actually run this
code yourself just by selecting

12
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,095
the code and hitting Shift+Enter, and

13
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:51,005
just run through it actually testing
all of the different pieces of code.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,590
And so I think a lot of people will
use this in a split screen mode.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,430
So you take this window out and
you watch the video in one window

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,530
while you actually walk
through the code in another.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,169
I think it's a great addition.

18
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,310
Jumping back, we also have
assignments that are built in.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,648
Jumping back to the course home page,
we'll go to week two.

20
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:19,480
In week two we have an assignment built
right into the jupiter notebook and

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,020
this is great.

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,740
So you can open the jupyter notebook for
assignment two.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,320
You get all of the questions
provided to you directly.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,645
You can open up the assignment,
you can directly see the questions.

25
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,710
There's stub code for your answers here.

26
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,700
So for instance for

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,810
question one where you have to figure
out how many gold medals there are.

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,050
There's a function written,
answer one, and

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,970
you just write in what
your response is here.

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,010
You can of course write any python that
you would like, in here, and so forth.

31
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,940
So this is a great way
to do your assignments.

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,460
When you've done your
assignment you just submit it,

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,270
by clicking the submit button at the top.

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,687
You can follow that URL to see
details about your submission.

35
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:11,747
In addition you can go to the course page,
click on the programming

36
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:17,400
assignment, And
look at your previous submissions.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,100
You can see here I've got a lot
of submissions because I've been

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,900
testing these notebooks.

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,040
But you can actually create
a custom solution of your own,

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,430
offline if you want to do all the work
with the Jupyter Notebooks on your PC,

41
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,020
just upload that file as appropriate and
submit it for grading.

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,830
So those are some of the features that
Coursera has added to the platform for us.

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,160
Some of the other features are in-video-quizzes 
that allow you to change the code

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,770
as you're watching the video.

45
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,718
So we'll see an example of that here.

46
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:58,660
When you're viewing the video you can
see a number of the IPython notebooks.

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,980
You'll see these yellow little
marker on the video timeline.

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,760
These are in video quizzes.

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,080
Something Coursera's added for us for this
course are, live code in-video-quizzes

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,480
where you can actually try out what
we're talking about directly in a quiz.

51
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,010
So here's an example of that.

52
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,460
If you want to run the code you
just hit the Run button and

53
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,580
it actually fires up Python on one of
Coursera's remote machines and tries it.

54
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,140
And you can fool around with
the method parameters for instance.

55
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,480
And rerun the code and explore
the question that's been presented to you.

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,700
And you just continue with the video
by hitting the Continue button.

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,062
These are some of the new features,

58
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,710
Coursera has added to the platform
to help people learn data science.

59
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,930
And I hope you'll tell us what you
think of the Jupyter notebooks, and

60
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,970
the new in-video quizzes.
