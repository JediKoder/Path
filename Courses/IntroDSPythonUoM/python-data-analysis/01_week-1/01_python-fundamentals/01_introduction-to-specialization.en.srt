00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:12,120
Welcome to an introduction
to Data Science with Python.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,000
This course is the first course
out of five in a larger Python and

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,040
Data Science Specialization.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,300
Each course progressively builds on your
knowledge from previous courses to give

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,400
you a well-rounded view of what
Data Science is, while helping you to

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,410
develop skills to practice data science.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,140
The specialization is of an intermediate
level or difficulty, and

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,600
we expect that you have studied some basic
programming and statistics in the past.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,580
In this specialization,

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,730
we're focused on teaching applied skills
using the Python programming language.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,690
There are many other tools that
one can use in data science,

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,110
such as specialized statistical
analysis languages like R, or

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,440
more general purpose programming
languages like Java and C.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,550
We chose Python as the basis for
this specialization for three reasons.

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,660
First, it's easy to learn.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,430
Python is now the language of choice for

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,797
introducing university
students to programming.

18
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:06,700
It's used in eight out of 10 of
the US's top computer science programs.

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280
Python programs tend to have minimal
templating that you've might have seen in

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,820
other languages, and

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,510
have more natural constructs for typical
tasks you might need to accomplish.

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,580
If you have programming experience, but

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,650
not Python-specific experience,
you can pick up Python very quickly.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,310
Second, it's full featured.

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,630
Python is a very general programming
language with a lot of built-in

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,930
libraries and excels at manipulating data,
network programming, and databases.

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,460
It's mature,

28
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,019
and there's plenty of resources
available from books to online courses.

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,600
Finally, Python has a significant set
of data science libraries one can use.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,490
The base of these is called
the SciPy Ecosystem, and

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,150
it even has its own conference series.

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,800
Both the interface that we're going
to use for doing assignments,

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,890
called Jupiter Notebooks,
and the main libraries for

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,840
the first two courses, Pandas and
Matplotlib, are part of the SciPy stack,

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,870
and provide an excellent basis for moving
into machine learning, text mining and

36
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,990
network analysis.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,980
This first course is
broken into four modules.

38
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,470
The first module focuses on
getting prerequisites in place and

39
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,530
reviews some of the basics
of the Python language.

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,530
Don't worry, if you already have Python
down and you want to be challenged,

41
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,190
we have some advanced
Python in here as well.

42
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,500
The advanced Python isn't
strictly necessary for

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,520
the rest of the specialization, but many
of these examples you might see on the web

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,740
or broader data science topics like
Big Data and real-time analytics,

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,140
might require a knowledge of some
of these more specialized features.

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,683
In the second module we're going
to dig into the pandas Toolkit.

47
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:44,283
The pandas Toolkit is a fundamental
in Python data science, and

48
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:48,920
provides a data structure for
thinking about data in a tabular form.

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,780
This Toolkit helps bring functionality
that exists in R into the Python world.

50
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,660
It's seen significant adoption
over the last five years.

51
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,340
Much of the thinking behind pandas
is similar to relational theory.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,050
So if you have a background in databases,

53
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,860
you'll find the pandas environment
fairly natural to work in.

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,790
At the same time, some of the more
advanced ways to query and

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,400
manipulate pandas' data frames like
boolean masking and hierarchical indexing

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,990
are different than in databases and
require some careful discussion.

57
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,849
So we'll discuss these in
module three of this course.

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,690
The final module of the course is
dedicated to the course project

59
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,490
where you'll take some datasets,
merge and

60
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,110
clean them, then process the data and
answer some questions.

61
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,890
In this week we'll discuss
basic statistical tests and

62
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,620
methods that ensure you have a solid grasp
going forward into the next course.

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,240
At the same time the intent is for

64
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,070
your course project to be a demonstration
of the skills that you've gained

65
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,810
in manipulating messy data
into something of coherence.

66
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,930
Before we go into programming
fundamentals, though, we'll talk a bit

67
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,250
more about what data science is, and
why it's sweeping over the world.
